Zenburn theme for conkeror

just place the directory into your conkeror config directory 
[~/.conkeror.mozdev.org] and load the theme in your conkerorrc 
[~/.conkerorc] with:

theme_load("zenburn-conkeror");

Note: 
This theme uses the excellent Consolas font. I would recommend Inconsolas if 
you don't want to use a MS font. To use Inconsolas or any other font 
with this conkeror theme, just change all occurances of Consolas to 
Inconsolas or whatever.
